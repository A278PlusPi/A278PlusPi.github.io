      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p class = "body_text"><b>Hey howdy hey!</b> My name is Anthony John Regner, but just call me Anthony. My online alias is “<span style = "color:#f00">A</span><span style = "color:#00f">278</span><span style = "color: #f60">+π</span>”, in three different colors, but if you prefer just alphanumerical characters, you may call me “A278pluspi”. I am 22.1 years old. I am a current student (8th semester) at Hunter College. Prior to <a href = "https://hunter.cuny.edu">Hunter College</a>, I completed my associates degree in June 2021 at <a href = "https://www.citytech.cuny.edu">City Tech.</a></p>

      <h1>Why Computer Science?</h1>
      <p class = "body_text">I am currently on track to be an aspiring software engineer, web developer, and/or an UI/UX designer. Since high school, I chose to pursue computer science, because there are lots of fun things I can do with technology. I seize opportunities to “make things come to life” using different programming languages and a variety of data structures I have learned so far. In addition, I love to customize my appearance of my <a href = "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows">Windows desktop</a>, using my “brand” colors and my favorite font (<a href = "https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto">Roboto</a>). This was made possible by using the Windows Registry editor and WinAero as well.</p>
      <p class = "body_text">My favorite part of computer science is that mathematics (especially discrete math) is highly integrated into computer science, which provides lots of applications that are essential to understanding how technology works such as combinatorics, logics, recursion, and even regular expressions. Mathematics has been my favorite subject since my childhood, and again when I completed Calculus 1. Not only I love discrete mathematics, I find discrete math “essential” in the software engineering world and in the K-12 curriculum. To supplement this, I have become an undergraduate teaching assistant for <a href = "https://www.coursicle.com/huntercuny/courses/CSCI/15000">CSCI 150</a> (Discrete Structures) to show my love for discrete mathematics and to get “soft skills” needed for the workplace.</p>
      <p class = "body_text">The most challenging part of computer science is programming, especially when dealing with parts that “break” my program. When this happens, in most cases, I either research why a part of my program is breaking it or implement workarounds. However, there are times that I ask for help from my colleagues to advance my development in my program. For example, I got stuck writing my parser for 6 days until I received assistance from one of the <a href = "https://www.coursicle.com/huntercuny/courses/CSCI/23500">CSCI 235</a> UTAs and provided me a simple and concise guide on writing my parser. After passing CSCI 235 in Spring 2022, it has changed my outlook on making programs.</p>
