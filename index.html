<b>Hey howdy hey!</b> My name is Anthony John Regner, but just call me Anthony. My online alias is “<span style = "color:#f00">A</span><span style = "color:#00f">278</span><span style = "color: #f60">+π</span>”, in three different colors, but if you prefer just alphanumerical characters, you may use “A278pluspi”. I am {floating-point age up to three decimals} years old. I am a current student (8th semester) at Hunter College. Prior to Hunter College, I completed my associates degree in June 2021 at City Tech.
