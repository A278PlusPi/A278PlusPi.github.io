It also covers certain material in statistics and probability, matrix algebra, and differential equations. In addition, it has [mathematical] games and other interactive stuff.<br/><br/>The recommend games to try out are the following:
            <ul>
              <li style="font-size: 90%;"><a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/puzzles/index.html">Puzzles</a> - Many of the games aligns with various topics in discrete mathematics</li>

It also spirals so students can gradually understand the material over time, rather than in one shot. Although it only covers material up until 6th grade, there are certain topics that can be cross-compatible with preliminary college courses.
